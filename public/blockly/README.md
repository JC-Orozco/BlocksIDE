Blockly has an active [developer forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/blockly). Please drop by and say hello. Show us your prototypes early; collectively we have a lot of experience and can offer hints which will save you time.

Help us focus our development efforts by telling us [what you are doing with
Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/registration). The questionnaire only takes
a few minutes and will help us better support the Blockly community.
