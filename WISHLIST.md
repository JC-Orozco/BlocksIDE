Juan Carlos Orozco WISHLIST:

Create helper functions for readability. Ex:
function repeat(times){...}. This requires repeat(times, function(){}). Maybe change this function call so that the anonymous function gets converted to a statment input list.
Generate this call when adding a repeat block (instead of the for block)

Support modules
Support extensions

When one selects a block -> code line is selected
When one selects a part of code -> corresponding block is selected

Use a safe eval() with debug options.
